# Welcome to my Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Scaffolding Process (Project Set up)

Open your terminal and move to your parent project directory: `cd prodev-mobile-setup`

Initialize a new Expo project using the latest Expo Router template: `npx create-expo-app@latest`
Enter the name of your project.

After the process is complete, move to your project directory: `cd my-mobile-app-project-name`.

To start the development server: `npx expo start`.

## Reset The Application
When I run the reset command : `npm run reset-project`, all the boilerplate code which was initiated with the project was removed and a new project structure was created. This involved the creation of a new **/app** directory and creation of a basic **index.tsx** file. 

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
